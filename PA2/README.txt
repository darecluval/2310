Problems I encountered with this assignment:
    - Keeping track of variables in each step
    - Formatting of print statements 

How you solved the problems: 
    - Writing it out on paper and describing the change in each variable and how to achieve it

My thoughts about the assignment:
Honestly, I thought it was a lot of busy work with the formatting. I think it would've been a more 
relevant assignment if it was given a few weesk ago with the multiplication HW.
